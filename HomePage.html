    <p class = "text">P-ai is building the modern incubator for CS projects and ideas—providing opportunities in 
        pre-professional software education at the 5C Claremont College Consortium. We enable students to engage on-campus 
        with the ever-expanding field of computing: featuring interdisciplinary projects in tech, finance, health, science, 
        and more.
    </p>

    <p class="text">Our core initiative is Project Teams: every semester, student and industry leaders choose to lead 
        self-designed project teams of their own choosing as Product Managers (PMs). Teams fall in one of our two divisions: 
        SWE or DS/AI. P-ai club members can then join specific teams as Project Members, working together with their group 
        throughout the semester to build something technical. 
    </p>

    <p class="text">P-ai also hosts general club workshops, panels, and events to develop a professional software skillset 
        and examine the latest research/applications and their respective ethical implications, in which students will 
        acquire a breadth of knowledge beyond enhancing technical competencies.
    </p>

    <p class="text">P-ai will strive to establish a culture of proactive curiosity-driven learning in addition to 
        practicing interdisciplinary communication. Ultimately, P-ai’s approach will offer a framework of informed 
        decision-making that is beneficial to all careers
    </p>

    <h1>You don’t need CS Experience to join the club! </h1>

    <p class="text">The club’s General Membership is open to all - sign up for our mailing list so you can get info on 
        our events and workshops. If you would like to work on a project team within the club, read below:
    </p>

    <p class="text">Project Members: After you indicate your interest in our application in what project you’d like to 
        work on, we will do our best to match you to a project. Since each project team comprises 3-6 members at the 
        discretion of the project manager, space is limited. You get hands-on CS experience and work together with your 
        teammates to produce something exciting! This role is recommended for people who like to work in teams and have 
        taken an introductory CS course.
    </p>

    <p class="text">We do not assume any previous knowledge in CS—no one can say they are truly fluent in these 
        technologies. However, the willingness to share and listen, grit and following through in completing a 
        project are important to us.
