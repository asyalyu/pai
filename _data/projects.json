    "description": "This project is a research oriented project that involves using deep learning and audio processing to develop efficient representations of audio recordings for piloting audio deep learning tasks. Lot of similar research is done with computer vision deep learning tasks. There exist many ways in which we can represent images: a feature matrix extracted by feeding an image into a pretrained image-recognition model which portrays content of an image or a gram-matrix extracted by transposing two copies of such a feature matrix  which portrays the style of an image. Many tasks like image recognition, neural image style transfer, and others rely on using efficient image representations. Just as in computer vision, it is thus highly critical to develop such efficient audio representations for corresponding audio tasks such as audio recognition, perhaps neural “audio” style transfer? Or, speech to text, and many others. We will explore different representations based on ideas discussed amongst the team and apply them to sample deep learning tasks to observe how well they perform.",

Artline is an interactive art history platform that allows users to explore art and artifacts throughout human history in a unified timeline. We started this project over the summer and built the first iteration, which we’re hoping to expand upon this fall with new members! Currently, the core product is a website where users can scroll through time and see artifacts from The Met Museum’s open-access collection that we’ve imported to our own database. We have also started to build out a feature where users can filter artifacts by medium, geography, and culture.",

    "description": "National Science Bowl is a prestigious, fast-paced competition requiring quick recall, teamwork, and strategy. Current practice methods for high schoolers rely on DOE (Dept. of Energy)’s archived packets, manual timing, and makeshift moderators. This creates inefficiency, because students juggle these “mod” roles amidst their practice, and also eventually run into the same questions to which they know the answers. Existing “Science Bowl apps” mainly consolidate old packets without replicating a real competition rigorously enough.",
