process for initializing the websites: 
- go to terminal 
- make sure you have pvp installed by doing pvp -v 
    - if not, then install pvp with brew install pvp 
- run php -S localhost:8000


process for adding email: 
- go to http://localhost:8000/mailinglist.html 
- enter in your email 
- after hitting subscribe, the link will change to http://localhost:8000/add_email.php
    - if it shows a disconnection error, it is likely because your terminal is 
    no longer running pvp 


process for checking email has been added: 
- in terminal, in the right directory, do "sqlite3 emails.db" 
- a "sqlite>" prompt should appear, then type in "SELECT * FROM mailing_list;" 
- this will display a list of all the emails, along with the time when they were added 
- to exit, then do ".exit"
